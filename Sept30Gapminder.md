9/30 essay: Go to the Gapminder data site (founded by Hans Rosling). The x and y axes can be changed with the little arrows. The year can be changed with the slider at the bottom. You can even have the plot play through time. Each bubble represents a nation and can be selected and deselected in the right panel. There's a two-minute "How to" video at the top as well.

Pick at least one configuration (life expectancy vs income in the UK and Cuba over the past 80 years, for example). Try any combination(s) you like (no wrong answers here). Write what data you are displaying. Write about what you see or what surprises you, if anything. As best you can, connect what you see to ideas in previous readings from Rosling, West, Sen, another course, or from your experience.


I chose the configuration of Life Expectancy vs Income in the United States and Switzerland over the past 100 years. From 1918 to 2018, the two data points stayed generally the same. There were times where Switzerland had slightly more income than the United States, but with the same life expectancy. Over the past 100 years, the two countries have grown and increased their income which increased their life expectancy as well. In 1918, Switzerland had a life expectancy of 55 years for an income of 10.3 k. The United States had a life expectancy of 55.4 years for an income of 12 k. The United States started off slightly ahead of Switzerland in these comparisons. As time passed, Switzerland’s Life Expectancy vs Income increased linearly at a steady rate. However, the United States had small dips and increases but still generally increased linearly as well. In 2018, the United States had a significantly higher life expectancy vs income compared to 1918, with a life expectancy of 78.9 years for an income of 62.5 k. As for Switzerland, they had a life expectancy of 84 years for an income of 68.4 k. Both countries started at an income level of 3 and had developed their countries in 100 years to reach an income level of 4. From these data sets, it shows that the higher the income per person, the chance to live longer increases. 

From the data shown in the Life Expectancy vs Income in the United States and Switzerland over the past 100 years, more successful and developed countries live on average a longer life. In Sen’s book, Development as Freedom, he discusses how having more freedom allows opportunities that people value,  which correlates to society’s development. Meaning that freedom is central to the process of development. However, unfreedom like low income leaves us vulnerable because even survival and basic civil rights are stripped away. Therefore, removing these unfreedoms is essential to development to increase life expectancy. Low income can be the reason for illiteracy, hunger, bad health, etc. Therefore, with a lower income, society lives shorter lives. However, better education and health leads to wealth. In 1918, the United States and Switzerland lacked these freedoms. The lack of these freedoms is the reason why people are deprived of basic capabilities, leading to lower income which shortens life expectancy. As time passed, the economies, opportunities, health, etc. of the countries flourished, hence why the Life Expectancy vs Income of these countries increased linearly.
