### Human Development Index (HDI)

11/2 Essay: Since this is a course on human development, I think you should be aware there exists a "Human Development Index (HDI)". This index attempts to quantify the level of human development of a country. It was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq and Indian Nobel laureate Amartya Sen. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) compiles the HDI of 189 countries in their annual Human Development Report. You can see the latest rankings here. It attempts to place people at the center of the development process in terms of economic debate, policy, and advocacy, and is framed in terms of whether people are able to "be" and "do" desirable things in life. The indicators used in the 2020 report were life expectancy at birth, expected years of schooling for children, mean years of schooling for adults, and gross national income per capita. These indicators are used to create a health index, an education index, and an income index, each with a value between 0 and 1. Read this for an overview.

Do you think additional information or data could be added to the HDI calculation to possibly improve it or make it a more accurate measurement of human development? If yes, what things? If no, why no? Keep in mind the conversation with Tyler Cowen.

The Human Development Index (HDI), developed by Mahbub ul Haq and Amartya Sen, was created to quantify the development of a country with people and their capabilities, rather than just economic growth. It measures whether a population can live a long and healthy life, be knowledgeable, and have access to resources to have a decent standard of living. Life expectancy at birth measures the health dimension, years of schooling adults of 25+ completed and expected years of schooling children of around 5 years old, and gross national income per capita is used to measure the standard of living dimension. While these three dimensions are important in calculating human development, I believe more factors could be measured to improve the estimation. The HDI does not measure factors like poverty, inequalities, human security, employment, environment, and empowerment. More indicators could be examined under the three dimensions as well. For long and healthy life, instead of just life expectancy at birth, the actual average life lived in a population could be measured. In terms of knowledge, instead of just years of schooling, degrees and post education paths could be observed. Lastly, to measure a decent standard of living, the GNI per capita is a great way to measure an average income of a country, the GDP per capita could be used as well. In the 2020 report, Norway is ranked first with an HDI of 0.957 and average annual growth between 2010 - 2019 of 0.20%. Most of these countriesâ€™ average annual growth rate is positively growing, and there is a mix of nations that have had a positive or negative change over the past 5 years (2014). In these rankings, nations ranked 1-66 are very developed countries, 67-119 are considered highly developed, 120-156 are medium, and 157-189 are considered low growth countries.
