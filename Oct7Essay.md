10/7 Essay: I want to introduce you to another source of sociology-focused data: Our World in Data, founded by Max Roser. Select a topic you are curious about from the dropdown "Articles by topic". If the topic is lengthy, you can pick just a graph or two.

Two cool things about the site are (1) there are concise descriptions of the topics, definitions of terms, and references; and (2) most (if not all) the plots have their data available for download as a csv. Their COVID plots are some of the best and up-to-date. 

Similar to 9/30's essay, write what topic (or graph(s)) you are looking at. Describe what you see. Are there trends? If so, what are they? Does anything surprise you? Where possible, connect what you see to previous readings, discussions, or your experiences.

Life expectancy is important to measure the health of a population. It gives us information about mortality along with one’s life and the average death in a population. In a pre-modern, poor world, life expectancy was very low, about 30 years. Since then, life expectancy has increased significantly in industrialized countries, while it remained low in poor countries. The average life expectancy has increased to over 70 years since 1900. In the Life Expectancy graph, it shows a map of the world color-coded in the appropriate life expectancy in the region. I notice North America to generally have the highest life expectancy ranging from about 74 to 86 years. South America has about 70 to 78 years of life expectancy. Poorer countries like Africa range from 50 to 70 years. This map shows that undeveloped countries live a shorter life than developed countries due to the lack of resources to live a long and fulfilling life. In the Expected Years of Living with Disability or Disease Burden graph, it displays the average number of years for an individual born with a disability to expect to live. I notice that developed countries are expected to experience 12+ years, while poorer countries are expected around 6  years. The more developed a country is, the higher the life expectancy is due to easier access to health care, education, and freedoms. Connecting this to Amartya Sen’s Development as Freedom, the population in these poorer countries experience a shorter life expectancy because their freedoms aren’t expanded, which limits them from opportunities that people value. Freedoms influences and develops the world we live in and it is the central process of development. Countries that have a lower life expectancy, life in Africa, suffer from unfreedoms like undernutrition, lack of healthcare, dirty water, etc. which leaves them vulnerable without survival and basic civil rights. Low income can be the reason for a lower life expectancy because of illiteracy, hunger, and bad health.
