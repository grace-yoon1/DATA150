### [The Belt and Road Initiative](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hidden-debt-plagues-chinas-belt-and-road-infrastructure-plan-studies-find-11632866461)

10/12 Essay: Read this press article on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a Chinese global infrastructure development plan. What are your thoughts, or more saliently, what questions do you have or what would you want to know/learn more about? What responsibilities do you think the international community should have (if any) on such matters?

In the Wall Street Journal article, “Hidden Debt Plagues China’s Belt and Road Infrastructure Plan, Studies Find,” debt and problematic projects are coming from the Chinese global infrastructure development plan, the Belt and Road Initiative. This project provides funds for developing countries to build transportation infrastructure, however, this plan brings several issues. I think the intent of this plan is good, but the way they are executing it is not the best way because these countries are put into large amounts of debt. There has been a debate on how China has used the great number of funds from the program in its projects. 

A research center at the College of William and Mary, AidData, found that 42 lower-income countries are in debt now due to China’s Belt and Road Initiative and how they are “exceeding 10% of their annual gross domestic product.” These developing countries having to owe more than their GDP is not what China claims in maintaining high-interest loans. The hidden debt of China’s loans not being included in their official borrowing has increased popularity due to lenders prefer to fund through corporations rather than governments. Many of China’s overseas infrastructure projects have experienced scandals, violations, hazards, and public pushback. This worsens poverty in these developing countries. These problems hinders development and freedoms of these countries from China’s Belt and Road Initiative. I believe that these developing nations can’t be put in debt with China in order to be successful and grow. 

The article discusses that $843 billion in loans have been used for 13,427 Chinese projects between 2000 and 2017. AidData discovered that Beijing always had three goals of turning this money earned from the nation’s exporters into foreign loans, pursuing building projects abroad, and securing commodities. Chinese lenders have agreed to suspend payments of other countries since COVID-19, however, China has become reluctant to do so. For many poor countries, China still is a rare source for funding their projects. I believe that more developed nations should be involved and to not have China’s interest rates as high to avoid these issues and allow developing countries to grow, rather than falling into debt.
