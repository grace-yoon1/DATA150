### [The Best Stats You've Ever Seen](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen?language=en)

#### What was Hans Rosling's observation regarding his comparative survey of students at the Karolinska Institute and the Chimpanzees (as well as the faculty who decide the Nobel Prize)? What is the significance of the results from his informal survey on preconceived ideas?

Hans Rosling did a pretest with his students at the Karolinska Institute by having them, “Which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs?” From the results, he discovered that the students got 1.8 out of 5 questions correct, which is significantly less than what chimpanzees would score. The chimpanzees knew statistically more about the world than these Swedish students, scoring an average of 2.5 out of 5. Rosling also observed that the Swedish professors of the Karolinska Institute were on par with the chimpanzees with a score of 2.4 out of 5. These survey results are significant because it reveals the need to communicate about data and preconceived ideas of the world.


#### What type of change took place in Asia that preceded economic growth? Why was this type of change significant?

In Asia, improvement in health and social change preceded economic growth. The size of families varied in industrialized countries compared to developing countries. In 1962, industrialized countries had small families and long lives, while developing countries had huge families and shorter life expectancies. Since 1962, these countries moved towards smaller families leading to longer lives. This transition from larger families to smaller ones developed a completely new world, changing economic and social growth tremendously. 

#### In accordance with Hans Rosling’s TED talk, what is the relationship between child mortality and GDP per capita?

According to Hans Rosling’s TED talk, there is a strong linear relationship between child mortality and GDP per capita. As the rate of child survival increases, GDP per capita increases as well. This supports his objective that the improvement of health in a country will allow the population to flourish economically. 

#### In terms of income distribution, how has the world changed from 1962 until 2003?

#### What is the significance of how Hans Rosling uses data to describe global human development in terms of very high spatial and temporal resolutions? How does this relate to his previous observation regarding preconceived ideas?

#### In your opinion, why was Hans Rosling’s work with the Gapminder project significant in contributing towards advancing the intersection of data science and global human development?
