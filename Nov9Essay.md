11/9 Essay: Read this November 2nd article on a change in use of facial recognition technology by Meta (formerly Facebook) (hat tip to Arthur). What are your general thoughts on government and private company utilization of technologies that are able to recognize a face and/or match a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces? What advantages or benefits could/do such technologies provide? What role (if any) should a government play in regulating their use by individuals or companies?

The article discusses that Facebook will delete a billion facial recognition data in their face-recognition system. They are backing away from technology because of the societal concerns of privacy. Technology needs to be balanced with the positive uses and not have too much that overpowers society. I think scaling back the use of facial recognition is a good idea. Having a database of faces to immediately recognize a face/match a human face is creepy to think about. However, technologies like this make everything easier. Using facial recognition can help improve security and it is a fast way to verify identity rather than remembering passwords. In the “Who is Civilization for?” video, Jaron Lanier discusses the Circle of Empathy and whether or not machines should be inside the circle. Expanding the circle too big where we have technology dominate everything could be dangerous, but keeping the circle small wouldn’t allow us to utilize technology in the way we do now. Therefore, I believe that we should find a zone where the circle is plausible for civilization and respects everyone’s privacy.
