10/21 Essay: After Dan's lecture, I would like to reinstall a bit of empirical optimism regarding the progress of humanity. Despite the very real difficulties data scientists, humanitarians, developers, and other leaders face, progress is being made over large time scales. Go to this website (a supplement to Peter Diamandis's 2012 book "Abundance") which illustrates various forms of progress across multiple dimensions of human well-being. Pick a topic heading. Write a description of each of the trends you see, i.e., for each figure. Do you think each trend actually represents progress? If not, why do you think? Finally, with Dan and Amartya Sen in mind, what do you think could be barriers to progress in each topic? (another way to think about this is: why do you think progress hasn't occurred even more rapidly?)

In Peter H. Diamandis’ “Abundance,” Diamandis included 80 charts displaying evidence of the growth and improvement of the world. He states that this trend has continued to grow over the last five years. There are charts of Increasing Happiness & Increasing Equality, Increase in Safety & Reduction in Violence, Increasing Health Abundance, Increasing Energy Abundance, Reducing Poverty, Increasing Technological Abundance, Increasing Learning & Literacy, and Increasing Global Connectivity. 

I picked the topic heading of Increasing Happiness & Increasing Equality. 

For the Annual Hours Worked per Person from 1870 to 1978 chart, there has been a general 50% decrease in hours worked over time in the United States, France, Japan, and Brazil. I believe that this trend actually represents progress because the fewer hours of work a person does, the happier they are. With each country reducing the hours worked at a similar rate, this increases equality as well, since the population in each country works the same amount of hours. 

For the Number of Democracies chart, the number of Democratic Regimes has increased in an upward trend over time. I believe that this tren actually represents progress because all citizens get the power and civic responsibility freely. With the number of governments increasing, it provides an inclusive and equal society where everyone is represented and free, increasing happiness for all.

For the Percentage of Slaves or Serfs in the World chart, the percentage has a decreasing trend over time. In 1750, the percentage of slaves and serfs were about 75% in the world, now, it is about 10%, which is a significant decrease. This decrease in slaves and serfs in the world allows happiness for these slaves and serfs to increase because they aren’t forced to be owned by an individual. With these slaves and serfs being free, they get the same rights and responsibilities as everyone else, which increases equality and fairness.

For Percentage of Degrees Awarded to Women, the percent has increased over the years. I believe that this trend actually represents progress because Women are given the opportunity to fulfill their education just like men, which increases equality. With this upward trend of more women obtaining degrees, they get to live their life happily in the way that they desire because opportunities aren’t as limited.

For the Closing the Gender Earnings Gap chart, there are a few trends represented regarding age range. The ratio of female to male earnings in the 45-64 years range has slightly increased over time. The ratio for 25-44 years has generally been constant over the years. The ratio for 15-24 years has slightly decreased over time. I believe that this trend actually represents progress because the gap between the ratios is decreasing over time. This means that women earn the same as men, which increases equality for all genders. Since women are being treated the same as men, this increases happiness.

For the Are Tech-Savvy Countries Happier chart, there is an increase in happiness as technology increases in a country. Countries with low technology have lower happiness levels. I believe that this trend actually represents progress because, with this information, data can be used to target countries with low technology and provide them with resources to increase their happiness. By providing high technology to these low-happiness countries will increase their equality as well since all countries would have high technology.

For the Homemakers’ Use of Time chart, there is a decrease in hours of work per week and an increase in free time over the years. I believe this trend actually represents progress because the homemakers don’t work as much, which increases their happiness from the increase in free time. With the balance of equal work and free time, this increases equality for their time as well.

For the How Often Do You Take a Shower in the Winter chart, the percent of the US population showering once a week has decreased from 17% to 1%. The population that showers at least once a day increased from 29% to 75% over time. I believe that this trend actually represents progress because the population has the ability to shower more because of the increase in technology, which increases their happiness from fulfilling the basic need to be clean. With the majority of the US population having access to showers over time, this increases equality as well.

Lastly, in the Weekly Work Hours chart, the work hours of full-time production workers in non-agricultural activities have decreased over the years. From 1870 to 2000, Switzerland, Italy, Belgium, and France have decreased weekly work hours at the same rate, meaning that work hours are equal over these four countries. With equality increasing, their happiness is increased as well because they don’t have to work as long.

Finally, I believe the barriers of each topic would be the lack of data, inability to apply data, low technology, lack of resources, etc. With barriers like these, progress is slowed down because each country is at different levels of development and there isn’t enough data and information to solve this appropriately and effectively.
