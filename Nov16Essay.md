11/16 Essay (last one): Read the ~8-minute article "The Data Science Behind Self-Driving Cars" (hat tip to Connor). In 1-2 paragraphs, write what you think (or know) are the broad implications for society from the development and adoption of self-driving vehicle technology. What are the positive aspects, the not so positive, and the important considerations (e.g., ethical)? 

A self-driving car must have highly detailed maps of street features, sensors, vehicle-to-vehicle cloud communications, and sensory inputs into the vehicle’s machine learning algorithms. There are LIDAR sensors that bounce pulses of light off the surroundings to find lane markings and edges of roads. Cameras are used to identify traffic lights, signs, vehicles, etc. Altimeters and accelerometers are used to get a more accurate positioning than GPS. From these tools, the car collects data and interprets that information with algorithms for perception, localization, prediction, planning, and control. This is done by using machine learning, deep learning, and AI where the algorithm is constantly trained to improve its driving. This technology can prevent car crashes, have better traffic efficiency, be a safe and reliable mode of transportation, and reduce emissions to be environmentally friendly. However, there are some not so positive aspects as well. There could be security issues from the possibility of hacking. For self-driving cars to communicate with each other, the same network would be shared and cause damage if hacked. Another big issue would be job losses. Those that depend on driving as a career, such as truck drivers, bus drivers, taxi drivers, etc. would find their job obsolete with self-driving cars. Lastly, there could be incidents involving machine error, putting the driver and those on the road in danger. Some may believe that self-driving cars are ethical because the algorithms are very smart, the cars are safer, and they will improve the world. However, some believe it isn’t ethical because some argue that random decisions are better than predetermined ones, they don’t want their destiny to be controlled in a car accident, and there are hackers and security issues.
