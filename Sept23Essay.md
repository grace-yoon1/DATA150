### Development and Evolving Solutions

Human development has been described by Selim Jahan (head of the UNDP program) as “development of the people (capital), for the people (translated to the lives of people) and by the people (people are not only receiving but active participant in the process).” How have we done as a humanity to fulfill this hope originally manifested through the Gettysburg address? Does data science have a role to play in advancing the human condition? What role does complexity play in advancing our understanding of global human development processes and their multitude of dimensions? In order to predict valuable solutions to some of the world’s most intractable problems, will combined domain expertise from the perspective of computer science & statistics with global human development be sufficient, or is a new integrated paradigm needed? What hope do we have in selecting the best future path for humanity? 


As Selim Jahan has described, human development is having the ability to enlarge people’s choices, capabilities, and freedoms. It is enhancing human lives and our freedoms to make our lives fuller, but also to influence and develop the world we live in. As humanity, we have fulfilled the hope originally manifested through the Gettysburg address by expanding real freedoms that people enjoy. We have removed deprivation and strengthened instrumental freedoms like political freedoms, social opportunities, protective security, etc. Removing unfreedoms, like undernutrition, lack of healthcare, etc., is essential to the central process development. The removal of unfreedoms allows us to have more freedoms and opportunities that people value, which correlates to society’s development. Political and civil freedoms are essential parts of human freedom, so without these human rights and freedoms, it deprives people of basic capabilities. Capabilities, such as access to knowledge and health, are valued and expanded by the institutions and conditions of our society. Access to education, healthcare, resources, etc. is an essential part of our lives because it allows us to live a long and healthy life, gain knowledge, and live a decent life. 

Data science does have a role to play in advancing the human condition. With data, society can analyze each country’s needs and what they flourish in. Data science informs humanity how developed a country is and creates actionable plans for those in need or those in deprivation. When considering the intersection of human development and data science, Blumenstock believes that “good intent”, “transparency,” and “balancing act” are essential. He stresses the importance of using data to complement, not to replace old data. With this, collaborating between “data scientists, development experts, governments, civil society, and the private sector” is a step towards advancing human development. 

In advancing our understanding of global human development processes and their multitude of dimensions, complexity is necessary because understanding what makes us complex allows us to increase development and quality of life. Transparency, one of Blumenstock’s ideas, is essential and needs to be increased for the complexity of these data and human development issues. Also, combined domain expertise from the perspective of computer science and statistics with global human development will be sufficient to predict solutions. With knowledge in both, they can be used to develop new models as the world continues to develop and expand on the complexity of the developing world. Human development is a complex process, so using evolving data science, transparency, and collaboration in humanity will select the best future path for humanity to enlarge and enhance freedoms and capabilities.
