### Presentation: Combining Satellite Imagery and Machine Learning to Assess and Analyze Poverty in India

---

#### Abstract

Poverty is a significant harm to countries all over the world. It causes millions of humans to face challenges like poor health and untenable living conditions. They are unable to fulfill their basic needs and capabilities to survive due to the lack of resources, goods, and services. Reducing the amount of poverty in the world is not simple, as it is difficult to know exactly where in these countries that individuals suffer from poverty the most. Without knowing these areas of poverty, development in these countries is slowed down, not allowing them to attain the freedoms to allow them to thrive. To find specific areas of poverty, I researched two data science methods using convolutional neural networks and geospatial and satellite data to spatially target and estimate poverty in these underdeveloped countries. I will assess geospatial data science methods utilized to assess poverty, model relationships between variables, and analyze interactions to produce findings in alleviating poverty in a developing country: India. In my research, I noticed a gap in existing research in mapping and estimating poverty with neighborhood-level resolutions of satellite imagery to obtain more refined and precise predictions.
