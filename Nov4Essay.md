### **In Class Essay**
##### November 4, 2021

11/4 Essay: We have five reading/watching slots left on our schedule. I'm looking to replace one that's there now I think is on the weaker side (Thursday 11/18) and I want your help. What topic haven't we discussed (or will discuss) within the realm of data science and/or human development that you would like covered and discussed in class? Is there a particular video or reading you are aware of that you like or think is valuable that you want the rest of the class to see/read? Briefly explain your thoughts and provide a link, if applicable. I will read your responses later today.

Personally, I would like to see how data can be used for mental health, a fundamental component of human development. Mental health is important and it is underrecognized, so I think it would be a great opportunity to learn more about it through a data science lens. Human development is the expansion of freedoms and capabilities to improve one’s well-being. Mental health issues limit human freedoms internally, which is interesting to me because most human development issues discussed in this course are related to external conditions of human populations. Mental health never has enough attention and I believe assessing these issues can be done through data. 

Another topic I’d like to explore in this class is how data science is used in social media. I find it fascinating how these data science algorithms can sort posts to personalize one’s feed to what they’d like to see. Social media is an aspect of most human’s lives and people spend a lot of time on social media. There are many datasets that could be used to analyze what’s best for a person’s timeline; times and locations using the social media platform, interactions, types of devices being used, etc. Recently, the app, TikTok, has been very popular because of how incredible TikTok’s recommendation system is. I’d like to learn more about how TikTok uses machine learning to analyze a user’s interactions to predict the likelihood of whether or not a user would like a video. I read this [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-tiktok-made-its-user-so-obsessive-the-ai-algorithm-that-got-you-hooked-7895bb1ab423) a while back about TikTok’s recommendation workflow and I find the process interesting. It expands on how machine learning interacts with the user and content. Overall, I would enjoy learning more about behind the scenes of social media algorithms. For me, TikTok algorithms are very intriguing because of how amazing it is at creating the perfect “For You Page.”
