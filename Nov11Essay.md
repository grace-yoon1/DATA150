### [The role of data in a world reshaped by COVID-19](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/role-data-world-reshaped-covid-19)

11/11 Essay: Read this October 2020 article from UPenn that's a set of statements by faculty from a broad array of fields on the ways in which data and data science are contributing to or affecting their field with respect to COVID and the pandemic (hat tip to Rhea).
Write 1-2 paragraphs on the following: From what you know about your prospective major, what is a permanent or semi-permanent way the pandemic has affected your field of study or an aspect of culture or society related to your field? Do you believe the change is net-positive or negative for society and why? What recommendations (if any) would you have for your field moving forward on the issue? For example, if you're a prospective business major, what are your thoughts on remote work and the use of office spaces and how businesses could think about "where" to work moving forward? Or, if you're a prospective psychology or sociology major, how has the virus and pandemic changed how people and societies view and react to germs?

In the article, “The role of data in a world reshaped by COVID-19,” it discusses how COVID and the pandemic have affected many fields from the different perspectives of UPenn faculty. Due to data and data science contributing, we are able to see a detailed view of where COVID-19 is spreading, how it’s mutating, and its effects on economies. In my major, computer science, the pandemic has affected it in several ways. The pandemic has led to people working from home, losing their jobs, and meetings to be virtual. It also led to an increase in demand for computer science majors to produce video call services, crypto, and remote security due to COVID-19. The use of artificial intelligence allowed computers to get information on the spread of COVID-19. In my experience, I work at Code Ninjas as a Computer Science Instructor, and during the pandemic, the center shut down, causing camps, coding sessions, instructing, etc. online. I didn’t get to interact with the kids I taught in person anymore and it was harder to monitor their progress from not being able to see their screen. I believe that this change both positively and negatively affected society. From the pandemic, we have learned how to adapt quickly and gain/grow skills we lacked as a society. However, it also hindered us because of the inability to engage and work together in person. Overall, the pandemic has affected many fields we have learned useful information and data from it, which can help us improve moving forward.
