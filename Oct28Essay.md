Taxonomically, in academia, data science is a subfield of computer science. Personally, I see data science as a tool or a set of tools and methods that a researcher or practitioner of data science applies to data in a particular domain.  This combination is their "craft", in essence. I, for example, apply data science to geography in the context of international development. This means I use tools such as machine learning on data such as satellite imagery to help solve problems in the international development community. Data science is a domain that can be surprisingly hard to define given its broad applications and newness. I don't necessarily think there's one correct definition and, whatever it is, the field will continue to evolve with new technologies, new industries, and/or new issues. There's also a question of skill ranges. Should the title of "data scientist" be reserved for those with doctoral degrees in the same way it is in physics, for example, and anyone below that is basically something else (like an analyst)?

Think about an area of study or field you care about (outside of your formal assignment topic), maybe the major you intend to choose. Based on what you read and know about data science and its related areas (data analysis, stats, and ML), briefly (1-2 paragraphs) write about how you think these disciplines could possibly be used in your field (it's okay to think ambitiously). If methods are already being used, what are they and to what extent (if you know)? If you are a prospective data science major, what ideas do you have for how data science could be used in ways you believe they are currently not? You have until 10:10.

I intend to major in computer science at William & Mary. Based on what I know about data science and analysis, many of these data science disciplines are used in the computer science field. Data Science is utilizing data to achieve the three goals of providing insight through analysis, establishing causality with statistics, and making predictions from machine learning. Computer Science tools, such as Python and R, are used to analyze and understand data. In fact, it is useful to have knowledge in programming to provide insight through automating analyses. Python and R can also be used to take the data collected and apply probability and mathematical rigor to establish causality with statistics. Lastly, the goal of making predictions from machine learning can be done through computer science, by producing a model from the data. Computer science is used to train those models made from data and it takes advantage of bigger data and power. I have also heard of other machine learning methods being used such as clustering and neural networks, in which that clustering is grouping similar data points in large data and neural networks are a series of algorithms trained to mimic the human brain to recognize patterns and relationships in the data. Data science requires a good understanding of “coding, ethics, communication, math and critical thinking,” which are all used in the field of computer science. Overall, Computer Science has a role in Data Science of working hands-on with big data that is collected with machine-learning and software development to achieve the three goals.
